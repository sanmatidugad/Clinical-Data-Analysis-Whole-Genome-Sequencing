# Clinical-Data-Analysis-Whole-Genome-Sequencing
This repository analyzes cancer genomic data obtained from tumor/normal whole exome sequencing of 50 patients who received the same type of treatment. Half of these patients responded to the treatment. The goal of this analysis is to discover mutations associated with treatment response.
